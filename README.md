# Arkanoid_OOP

The old classic Arkanoid game, implemented in pure object oriented code design.
thorough useage of known design patterns such as - wrappers, listener.
heavy useage of inheritance and interfaces in code archtecture.

you are welcome to check out the code, and i am always happy to hear notes and new ideas for improvments!

and of course - to enjoy the game, download the .jar file to you computer and double click it.

 I challenge you to finish lever number 4!
 good luck.
